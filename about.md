# My Project:
Hello, my name is Dmitry and my personal project is going to be about building a desktop computer for personal use.
This project is about knowledge and applying the knowledge to real life situation, this situation being building a computer. The Project is also to help me build up my understanding of technology around computers along side with that to be able to customize my design in the years to come and see how flexible a Desktop computer can be. My design will be simple with only basic parts at first as to optimize it to the fullest later on. My Desktop will also be mostly for high video resolution and high running graphics also the Desktop will also have many empty slots to be able to upgrade it later on in life.
