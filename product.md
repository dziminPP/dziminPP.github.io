* Case: For the first part the case needs to be inspected and a plan made for where all the part are going through along with the wiring

<br><br>
The manual for the Desktop case - Fractal Design Define R4 - how it is organized

* Motherboard: After reading and inspecting the case it was time to put the motherboard into the computer - foundation for all the other parts like a foundation for a building.
<img src="/images/motherboard.jpg">

* CPU: Before putting the motherboard into the case. The CPU (Central Processing Unit), The brain of the computer, had to be put into the motherboard - as it's easier to do and safer attaching the CPU outside the case before putting with motherboard inside.
<br>
* CPU: How a CPU looks underneath
<img src="/images/cpu_1.jpg">
* CPU: The CPU is being held in place by a bracket also the CPU details the specs: i5-4690K, 3.50GHz
<br>
i5 means it is a duel core and is the mid-range processor
<br> 3.50GHz means its speed of processing

<br><br>
* Fan: The next component is the cooling unit which is a Intel fan the came with the CPU, this is important as a CPU can reach 60 degrees Celsius depending on what it is processing and how much of the CPU is being take up by that process.
* Fan: The more strain on the CPU the higher the temperature gets and it can get too high to a point where the CPU will stop working depending on the brand the CPU could just shutdown or melt.
<img src="/images/fan_1.jpg">
The fan is not independent so it adjust its cooling to the temperature of the CPU

<br><br>
* GPU: The next step is to install the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) basically a graphics card. As the name tells the GPU displays graphics on the monitor.
* GPU: a computer can work without a GPU but it will not display anything except for the BIOS (instructions for the firmware )
<img src="/images/gpu_1.jpg">
<img src="/images/gpu_2.jpg">
* GPU: The GPU goes into the PCI-E (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express) is a bus (path) to a destination - its useful since only GPU and other high-performance peripherals(components) can use it and get no interference with other computer components.
<img src="/images/gpu_4.jpg">
/\ as seen above the PCI-E: 2(out of 5) are located above and below "Z97 Extreme9" /\

<br><br>

* PSU:Now it is time to connect the PSU - power supply unit (battery) which was the easiest yet a stressful part.
* PSU: It is not the fact of electrocution (may seem scary but with the socket unplugged it will not happen) but it was the fear of frying/bricking the rest of the components. After realizing that there is no chance of that. It had seemed that I was looking at all the worse scenarios possible when there was no need.
<img src="/images/pu_1.jpg">
This battery was apparently broken from the start and unfortunately for me since I had not built a PC before I could not tell for 4 to 5 hours that it was the battery that was broken. Yes, it took me 4 to 5 hours to figure out that the battery was broken and the reason for that is that I presumed that the other components would not work if something was misplaced. That theory was wrong as when power is switched on it actives all components for a few second before turning them off again.
<img src="/images/battery.jpg">
\/ This is how I tested if it was the battery or other computer components. \/
<br>
turned out to be quite fun and intriguing
<img src="/images/test_1.png">
* since the first battery was broken I had to acquire a second one which was a bit of an overkill. This is because the PC needs 247 Watts to run and instead it got around 1500 Watts but I am not complaining if it works it works.
<img src="/images/battery_2.jpg">
<br><br>

* Wiring: Probably the most tedious and frustrating part of the process - at least for me.
<img src="/images/wire_1.jpg">
/\ As you can see there are a moderate amount of wires here /\
<br>
| it was not a hard process but getting them to their place and leading them through takes a bit of
<br>
| work
<br>
| the image is blurry but you can see to the left the amount of wires, not too many
<br>
| The wires are either from the PSU (power supply unit) or from the case - the turn on switch, usb,
<br>
\/ jack, etc...

* End: The next thing to do is to enjoy my new creation.

# Evaluating Your Product

5 Aspects to Consider

Criterion 1

* To be able to grow as a Global Citizen through Applying learning in a real-world context and Developing intellectual rigour in real life situation.
* To be able to apply my Creativity and Curiosity to my project and take Initiative over building.
* To increase and explore my love of learning for the subject that I find Interesting and fun to know and be apart of.
<br><br>
Score: 6
<br>
more Initiative could have been taken to build the computer but when started the Initiative did come. Love of learning was the biggest breakthrough as it helped me to understand and have fun making a computer.

Criterion 2

* To Understand what how a computer works, how it communicates with its components.
* Have the knowledge of most to all computer components and why they are need for the computer to work.
* To be able to effectively construct and plan any future computer builds with more confidence, less error and at a faster speed.
<br><br>
Score: 6
<br>
There is still a lot of knowledge about how computers work but there is also a lot of it to take it but there is a basic and a more developed understanding of computers and how it communicates. Additionally I am able to effectively custruct and plan any future computer builds.

Criterion 3

* To see if the computer is running properly.
* To identify any problems and to be able to fix them.
* To run a high demanding program at 60 frames per second and maintain good quality.
<br><br>
Score: 7
<br>
The computer haw passed through all the tests and is running very smoothly and all the points have been met the requirements.

Criterion 4

* To have the wiring be clean and tidy, the wires have to run through the back panel of the motherboard.
* To be able to add additional parts without any additional risk to the computer or to rewire the computer.
* To make sure all ports and are working correctly.
<br><br>
Score: 6
<br>
The Wiring could be cleaner as it takes some effort to close the case, at least one of the side panels, then anticipated but all ports and working correctly and adding additional components should not be that tedious as most of the wiring is correct just not tidy.

Criterion 5

* The basic software has been installed to be able to start up the computer in BIOS or low graphics
* The install all necessary drives into the computer and to update them regularly
* To install further software such as google Chrome, CPUD, etc...
<br><br>
Score: 7
<br>
All the necessary and luxury software has been installed.
